# My POSIX Shell Project 🐚

In this project, I built my own POSIX-compliant shell from scratch. My shell can interpret commands, run external programs, and handle built-in commands like cd, pwd, echo, and more.

Along the way, I learned a lot about:

- Shell command parsing – how commands entered by a user are interpreted and executed

- REPLs (Read-Eval-Print Loops) – the interactive loop that keeps the shell running

- Built-in commands – implementing internal commands without spawning a new process

- Process management – launching and controlling external programs

This project was a great way for me to dive deep into how shells work under the hood, and it gave me hands-on experience with system programming concepts like forks, execs, and input/output redirection.
